# Navigation Fix Test Results

## Fixed Issues:

1. **Previous Week Navigation** ✅
   - Updated `previousWeek` function to call `loadData()` after changing weeks
   - Removed the unused `clearSchedulesForNewWeek` function
   - Now loads data for the selected week instead of clearing schedules

2. **Next Week Navigation** ✅
   - Already fixed in previous commit
   - Calls `loadData()` after changing weeks

3. **Empty Week Handling** ✅
   - Updated `hasAnySchedules()` to check if schedules object exists
   - Added safety checks for user schedule data
   - Shows "No schedules for this week" message instead of error

## Code Changes Made:

### app/dashboard/page.tsx
- Added `loadData()` call in `previousWeek` function
- Removed `clearSchedulesForNewWeek` function

### components/weekly-schedule.tsx
- Added safety check in `hasAnySchedules()` for empty schedules object
- Added safety check when accessing user schedule data: `schedules[user.id] && schedules[user.id][day]`

## Expected Behavior:
- When navigating to previous/next week, the app should load schedules for that week
- Empty weeks should display a friendly "No schedules for this week" message
- No "Schedule Error" messages should appear during navigation
