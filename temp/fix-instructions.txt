The WeeklySchedule component has these key issues:
1. Leftover code fragments causing syntax errors (lines ~262-300)
2. Missing implementation of checkMobile function and setIsMobile
3. Missing implementation of setCurrentUserName
4. Various orphaned code fragments

Fix needs to:
1. Remove all orphaned code fragments
2. Ensure the useRealtime hooks are properly integrated
3. Fix implementations of missing functions
4. Ensure proper component lifecycle
